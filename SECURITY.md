## Reporting a Vulnerability

I greatly appreciate the efforts of security researchers and the responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities. If you discover a security vulnerability in the plugin, please follow the steps below to report it:

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue.
2. Send an email at [hello@vagelis.dev](mailto:hello@vagelis.dev) with a detailed description of the vulnerability. Please include the following information:
   - Plugin version affected
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
   - Potential impact of the vulnerability
   - Any known workarounds
3. I will acknowledge your email within 48 hours and provide an estimated time frame for addressing the vulnerability.

I encourage responsible disclosure and request that you give me a reasonable amount of time to address the issue before making the details public.

I will not take legal action against researchers who responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities in my plugin, provided they follow the guidelines above.

Please note that I do not offer monetary rewards for identifying security vulnerabilities.
